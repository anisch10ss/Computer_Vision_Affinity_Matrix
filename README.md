# 🧠 Affinity Matrix – Computer Vision & Data Analytics Module

A cool data-driven feature built to analyze and visualize relationships between entities (like users, behaviors, or objects) in a computer vision project. This module uses a matrix-based approach to determine affinity scores, patterns, and correlations.

---

## 📌 Key Feature: Affinity Matrix

The **Affinity Matrix** dynamically computes similarity or correlation between elements based on extracted features or interaction history. Results are visualized in an interactive, color-coded matrix using JavaScript and D3.js (or any other frontend lib).

### Use Cases:
- 🧍‍♂️ User behavior similarity
- 🧠 Object recognition correlation
- 📊 Feature matching & data clustering

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **JavaScript / HTML / CSS**
- **Chart.js / D3.js / Heatmap.js** (Optional for matrix display)
- **AJAX / Fetch API** – API communication

### Backend
- **Python + Flask API**
- **NumPy / Pandas / Scikit-learn** – Data processing and matrix generation
- **CORS** – Cross-origin access for frontend-backend integration
